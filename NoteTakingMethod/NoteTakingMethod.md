# Note Taking Method


## File System
Every MD file has its own folder that contains everything related to that MD  
Example:  

- Folder_1/
  - File_1.md
  - Folder_2/
    - File_2.md
    - img_2.png
  - Folder_3/
    - File_3.md
    - Folder_4/
      - File_4.md

## MD Rules
- ***Back*** button in the header  
- ***Links*** for every resource

## Images  
For the images I use:
- ***Excalidraw***  
  > for sketches
- ***Drawio***  
  > for diagrams
